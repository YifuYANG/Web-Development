				<div class="title">New Research shows Felt is the cure for all Modern Viruses</div>

						<p class="lead">Recent research from University College Dublin has demonstrated the medical value
						of felted viruses. Results from an experiment by Associate Professor Rem Collier found that hugging
						a felted sculpture of a virus demonstrated a 100% success rate for immunisation from a range of viruses.
						</p>
						<p>The results were attained through a comprehensive trial of 10 people who were asked to hold a felted 
						virus sculpture for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes had passed, a blood sample was taken and tested for the 
						presence of the virus corresponding to the sculpture that they had held. In all cases, the tests came back 
						negative.</p>
						<p>When asked to comment of the results, Professor Collier enthused &quot;these results were amazing, completely
						unexpected&quot;. When asked how he came up with idea, he said &quot;I got the idea for the experiment when I was having
						a bad day. I grabbed the nearest thing to me - a sculpture of the Coronavirus. It gave me such a warm and fuzzy
						feeling to hug it, so I did it again the next day. It was only after a couple of weeks had passed, that I noted 
						I didn&#39;t have Coronavirus, so I started to wonder whether the sculpture was protecting me...&quot;</p>
						<p>Professor Collier was clear that these results were only preliminary and further studies were required. He
						outlined plans for a larger trial involving people hugging virus sculptures while travelling on Dublin Buses.</p>
						<p>In a recent tweet, current US president, Donald Trump, hailed the treatment as a game changer. He went
						on to describe an immunisation plan that would also benefit the economy: installations of virus sculptures at 
						Starbucks Coffee Shops across the country. As part of the plan he announced that he  would shortly be signing 
						an executive order for 10 million felt virus sculptures from a local Irish feltmaker. When contacted, the
						feltmaker, who declined to be named, stated that she was a sole trader and could make no more than 3 virus 
						sculptures per day. Expectations are that she will complete the order in a little over 9,000 years.
